# Smart Dots

A genetic evolution simulation with dots moving towards a goal. Each dot is initialized with a random color and a random set of move. As
they move toward the goal there fitness score is increased. Dots with the highest fitness score are most likely to be the parents for the
next generation passing on their color and moves.
